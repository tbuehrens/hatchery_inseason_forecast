# hatchery_inseason_forecast
This repo contains code to produce in-season forecasts of hatchery returns. It utilizes two approaches: 1) a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) utilizing a log-link function and a negative binomial distribution with a tensor product interaction between day of year and year (using cyclic cubic regression splines for the day of year effect and penalized splines for the year effect, with second and first order penalities, respectively) to predict daily counts of hatchery fish after being fit to past years of daily counts and in-season data from the current year, 2) a Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model utilizing a log-link function of hatchery counts. The model breaks counts into those occuring before a particular date of interest and those occurring after and predicts the total count for the remainder of the season (as  opposed to for each day for the remainder of the season). Bothe methods are performance tested on simulated data.
